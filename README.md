# GT-work
This repository contains information about the work I did in my MS program in bioinformatics at Georgia Tech from August 2018 to May 2020.

In spring 2019, I was a member of the Genome Assembly Group in my Computational Genomics Class. We described our work developing a genome assembly in the following wiki page: https://compgenomics2019.biosci.gatech.edu/Team_I_Genome_Assembly_Group

In the same spring 2019 class, I was also a member of the Comparative Genomics Group, whose work is discussed in the following wiki page: https://compgenomics2019.biosci.gatech.edu/Team_I_Comparative_Genomics_Group
